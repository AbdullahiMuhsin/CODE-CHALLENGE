# Students' Grades Calculator

## Introduction
This script is designed to assign letter grades to a list of students based on their scores. It uses a simple grading scale where each score range corresponds to a specific letter grade.

## Description
The script defines an array of student objects, where each object contains a `name` and a `score`. It then iterates over this array, assigning grades according to the following scale:
- **A**: 79 to 100
- **B**: 60 to 78
- **C**: 50 to 59
- **D**: 40 to 49
- **E**: Below 40

After assigning the grades, it prints out each student's name along with their assigned grade.

## How to Run
To run this script, you will need a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js. Copy the code into a file named `gradeStudents.js`, and then execute it in the terminal.
node gradeStudents.js
